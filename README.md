# Professional README Generator

## Description

  The Readme Generator app will automatically generate a ReadMe file for its user. This is to assist with shortening the length of time required to create a ReadMe file for a web app or webpage.
  The file is generated by the user answering a series of questions. Eventually, all the answers are arranged into an automatically generated readme file.
